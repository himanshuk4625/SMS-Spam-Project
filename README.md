# SMS-Spam-Project
This repository contains the code for the SMS Spam Project, which is a machine learning project that detects and classifies SMS messages as either spam or not spam

# Overview
The SMS Spam Project is built using the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains over 5,000 SMS messages that are classified as either spam or not spam. The project uses various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify new SMS messages as either spam or not spam.

# Files
The following files are included in this repository:

## SMSSpamCollection.csv: The SMS Spam Collection dataset.
## SMS_Spam_Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
## README.md: This file.
## app.py: Python file for deploying this project using Streamlit
## vectorizer.pkl , Model.pkl: pickle files for used in app.py file
# Dependencies
The code was written in Python 3.10 and requires the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
nltk
These dependencies can be installed using pip.

# Usage
